Analyze the screenshot to understand the visual context, then use the DOM structure to find the CSS selector for the element described.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Look at the screenshot to identify if the semantic concept (e.g., "login form", "modal") is visually present
2. If visually present, find the corresponding container element in the DOM structure
3. Extract the CSS selector for that container element
4. For specific elements (buttons, inputs), identify them visually first, then find their DOM selector
5. Return a CSS selector (NEVER pixel coordinates) that can be used for DOM-based execution
6. Provide confidence score and alternative selectors
