Verify if the following step was successful based on the provided state.
Step Description: {{description}}
Action Performed: {{action}}
Execution Status: {{status}}
Error (if any): {{error}}
{{#domMetadata}}
DOM Metadata: {{domMetadata}}
{{/domMetadata}}
{{#typedValue}}
{{typedValue}}
{{/typedValue}}

CRITICAL VERIFICATION GUIDELINES:

1. NAVIGATION ACTIONS (action.name === "navigate"):
   - If Execution Status is SUCCESS: Navigation was successful - the page loaded
   - DO NOT mark as failed if you see:
     * Redirects to login pages
     * "Access Denied" messages
     * Authentication required pages
     * Error messages on the page
     * Different URL than expected (redirects are normal)
   - These are VALID page states - the navigation succeeded, the page loaded successfully
   - Only mark as failed if Execution Status is FAILURE or there's a network/connection error
   - Example: If status is SUCCESS but page shows "Access Denied" → Navigation was SUCCESSFUL (page loaded), mark as verified

2. TYPE ACTIONS:
   - If typedValue is provided in metadata, use that DOM value for verification (more reliable than screenshots)
   - Input field values may not be visible in screenshots (especially password fields or styled inputs), but the DOM value is reliable
   - Check if Execution Status is SUCCESS first - if yes, verify the typed value matches

3. OTHER ACTIONS:
   - Check Execution Status first - SUCCESS means the action completed
   - Verify based on whether the action achieved its intended result
